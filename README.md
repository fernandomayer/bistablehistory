# Cumulative History Analaysis For Bistable Perception Time Series

A package to compute a cumulative history for time-series of perceptual
dominance in bistable displays.

Estimates cumulative history, an estimate of accumulating
adaptation/prediction error for the dominant percept, for time-series
for continuously viewed bistable perceptual rivalry displays. Computes
cumulative history via a homogeneous first order differential process.
I.e., it assumes exponential growth/decay of the history as a function
of time and perceptually dominant state. Supports Gamma, log normal, and
normal distribution families.

For details on rationale please refer to
(Pastukhov & Braun, 2011)[https://doi.org/10.1167/11.10.12].

## Installation

For current stable version use

```r
install.packages("bistablehistory")
```

The master branch is the development version. To install it please use

```r
library("devtools")
install_github("alexander-pastukhov/bistablehistory", dependencies=TRUE)
```

## Usage

The main function is `fit_cumhist` that takes a data frame with time-series as a first argument. Minimally, you need to specify `state` --- string with the column name that encodes perceptually dominant state --- and either `duration` (column name with duration of individual dominance phases) or `onset` (column name with onset times of individual dominance phases). Thus, for a simplest case of a single subject and single run/block measurement with all defaults (gamma distribution, fitted cumulative history time constant but fixed mixed state value and history mixing proportion) the call would be
```r
library(bistablehistory)
data(br_singleblock)
gamma_fit <- fit_cumhist(br_singleblock,
                        state="State",
                        duration="Duration")
```
or, equivalently
```r
library(bistablehistory)
data(br_singleblock)
gamma_fit <- fit_cumhist(br_singleblock,
                        state="State",
                        onset="Time")
```

Now you can look at the fitted value for history time constant via
```r
history_tau(gamma_fit)
```

and main effect of history for both parameters of gamma distribution
```r
coef(gamma_fit)
```
